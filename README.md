[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tommyclark/asciigit.svg?token=YfxAsFSSF6uMWM3sNFjo&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tommyclark/asciigit) [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/asciigit)](https://pypi.org/project/asciigit) [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Asciigit is a terminal UI for [Git](https://git-scm.com). The aim of this project is to make it easier
for you to interact with your Git repositories in the terminal, either
locally or when connected to a remote server over SSH.

## How to install
You can install this application via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/asciigit):
```
pip install asciigit
```

## How to open
Navigate to the directory containing the Git repository you want to open, and
run:

```shell
asciigit
```

## How to use
Either use your mouse to click around the terminal interface, or use the tab 
and enter buttons to navigate the screens.

There's also a key binding for ctrl-a that'll open up a shortcuts window.
